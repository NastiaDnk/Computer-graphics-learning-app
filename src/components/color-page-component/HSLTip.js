                    the centre of this double cone, the more saturated your colour will be. Here we use <b>saturation (S)</b> and change it from 0 to 1. 
                    To change the lightness move vertically through the centre of your cone. <b>Lightness (l)</b> also changes from 0 to 1.</span>
